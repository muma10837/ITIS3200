This is my Intro to Information Security and Privacy class. For the first project was supposed to be a simple server client where it echoed back info. I turned it into a multi-threaded one for some extra fun. Second assignment was a written item. Third assignment was a multithreaded client server with capabilities to join and leave. I added in different options like joining different rooms and other fun things. Last assignment was a chat program with an encryption decryption.
